To whom it may concern,

Hello and a fine day to you! You have, for your prominence as an artist, art collector or art connoisseur, been invited to participate in an exclusive art gallery and auction! Your role, to which you are surely familiar, determines your responsibilities and permissions at this event. Consult the following list for a description of roles you may not be familiar with and yours too, should you be having an off day and simply can't tell the sky from the ground nor the role to which you have owned your many successes to â€” well, I digress and the roles are as follows:

Typically, all art is provided by the house gallery. However, art submitted by attending collectors and artists will replace an item from the house gallery.

Note that art displayed at this event and sold at auction do not have verification of authenticity. It is the buyer's responsibility to independently verify authenticity or assume risk when buying.

You may consult at any time the handbook provided to you when you arrive. It will describe your role, responsibilities and additional important information like the location of the bathrooms and catering.

We hope to see you at this event and many more in future years.

With warm regards,

The Fine Art Gallery and Auction House
